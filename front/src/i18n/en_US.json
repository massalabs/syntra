        "transfer-desc-1": "Bridging assets from Ethereum to Massa involves three transactions: approving the bridge to spend tokens, locking the tokens on the Bridge contract, and minting tokens on the Massa network. The processing time for each transaction depends on Ethereum confirmation times, typically between fifteen seconds to five minutes. Once confirmed on Ethereum, it should take less than two minutes for the bridge to mint tokens on Massa.",

Typically, with Metamask, this can be done by checking the “Activity” tab. If your wallet has recorded your transaction but you still don’t see it on the explorer, please make sure that you waited for the confirmation time to elapse (typically less than five minutes on Ethereum). If the transaction that doesn’t appear on the explorer is the lock transaction, you can check if your token balance has changed. If it hasn’t, it most certainly mean that the lock transaction wasn’t successful. In this case you should retry to send the lock transaction in the Massa Bridge web app. If previous checks do not solve your issue and you still don’t see your transaction please contact ",
